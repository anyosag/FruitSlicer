# FruitSlicer

Resin (MSLA) support generator, targeting the **Elegoo Saturn 4 Ultra 16K**
(15120×6230 px, 14×19 µm pixels, tilt release).

Goals: supports that leave small, well-placed marks, come off easily, and use
as few contact points as the print physically allows. The design, the research
behind it, and the milestone plan are in
[`docs/resin-support-plan.md`](docs/resin-support-plan.md).

## Status

| Milestone | State |
|---|---|
| M0 — foundation: STL I/O, nonzero mesh slicer, mesh minima/thickness, island graph, printer profile, overlap coupon | done |
| M0.5 — calibration coupons (tips, spacing, islands) | next |
| M1 — capacitated support-point generator | planned |
| M2 — heads, pillars, raft, supported-model export | planned |

## Build

Requires CMake ≥ 3.24 and a C++20 compiler (GCC 12+, Clang 15+). Dependencies
(Clipper2, CLI11, nlohmann/json, nanoflann, Catch2) are fetched by CMake.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build
```

## Usage

```sh
# Mesh statistics: shells, manifoldness, volume, downward-facing minima
./build/src/fruitslicer info model.stl

# Place (rotate, centre, lift 5 mm), slice at 0.05 mm, report islands; optional debug PNGs
./build/src/fruitslicer slice model.stl --rotate 30 0 0 --elevate 5 --layer 0.05 \
    --png-dir out/layers --every 20 --json out/report.json

# Week-1 compatibility test: overlapping shells (see below)
./build/src/fruitslicer coupon overlap -o overlap_coupon.stl --png-dir out/overlap_ref
```

### Overlap coupon (please run this first)

FruitSlicer exports the model and its supports as one STL made of overlapping
closed shells, which the printer's slicer must merge. `coupon overlap` builds a
small test piece: a raft, nine supports whose tips sink 0.2 mm into a plate, a
box buried inside the plate, and two crossing bars on top. Load
`overlap_coupon.stl` in **Elegoo SatelLite** and **CHITUBOX**, then scrub the
slice preview to the heights listed in the command's output. A correct slicer
shows solid material at each height (compare with the reference PNGs). Rings
around the tips, a square hole in the plate, or a hollow cross mean that the
slicer fills shells even-odd, and FruitSlicer will need to export a merged mesh
instead.

## Licence

Not chosen yet. Until it is, no code is copied from AGPL projects (PrusaSlicer,
UVtools); their algorithms are re-implemented from their descriptions.
